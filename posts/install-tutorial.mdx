# Getting Started with Python on Windows

Welcome to the beginner's guide to installing Python on a Windows system and creating your first project. Let's get started!

## Step 1: Download Python

1. **Visit the Python website**: Go to the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/).
2. **Download Python**: On the homepage, you will see a button that says "Download Python 3.x.x". Click on it to download the latest version of Python.

## Step 2: Install Python

1. **Run the installer**: Locate the downloaded installer file (usually in your Downloads folder) and double-click to run it.
2. **Customize installation**: 
   - Make sure to check the box that says "Add Python 3.x to PATH".
   - Click on "Customize installation" if you want to select optional features, but the default options are fine for most users.
   - Click "Next" and then "Install".

3. **Wait for the installation to complete**: This might take a few minutes. Once done, click on "Close".

## Step 3: Verify the Installation

1. **Open Command Prompt**: Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and press Enter.
2. **Check Python version**: Type `python --version` and press Enter. You should see the version of Python you installed.

```bash
python --version
```

## Step 4: Install an IDE (Optional)

While you can write Python code using any text editor, an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) can make the process easier. One popular IDE for Python is [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).

1. **Download PyCharm**: Go to the [PyCharm website](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/) and download the Community edition.
2. **Install PyCharm**: Run the installer and follow the instructions.

## Step 5: Write Your First Python Program

Let's write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!".

1. **Open your IDE** (PyCharm or any text editor like Notepad).
2. **Create a new file**: Save it with a `.py` extension, for example, `hello.py`.
3. **Write the code**: Type the following code into your file:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

4. **Save the file**.

## Step 6: Run Your First Python Program

1. **Open Command Prompt**: If it's not already open, press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and press Enter.
2. **Navigate to your file's directory**: Use the `cd` command to change directories. For example, if your file is on the Desktop:

```bash
cd Desktop
```

3. **Run the program**: Type `python hello.py` and press Enter. You should see the output:

```bash
Hello, World!
```
