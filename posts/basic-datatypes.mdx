# Understanding Basic Python Data Types

In Python, data types are an essential concept, as they determine the kind of operations you can perform on the data. Let's explore some of the basic data types in Python.

## 1. Numbers

### Integer (int)
Integers are whole numbers, positive or negative, without a decimal point.

```python
age = 25
year = 2024
temperature = -5
```

### Float (float)
Floats are numbers that have a decimal point.

```python
price = 19.99
height = 5.75
pi = 3.14159
```

## 2. Strings (str)
Strings are sequences of characters enclosed in single, double, or triple quotes.

```python
name = "Alice"
greeting = 'Hello, World!'
multiline = """This is a
multiline string."""
```

## 3. Boolean (bool)
Booleans represent one of two values: `True` or `False`.

```python
is_student = True
has_license = False
```

## 4. Lists
Lists are ordered, mutable collections of items, which can be of different types. They are defined using square brackets.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4.5, 6.7]
mixed = [1, "apple", True, 3.14]
```

### Accessing List Elements
You can access elements in a list using their index, starting from 0.

```python
first_fruit = fruits[0]  
# "apple"
second_number = numbers[1]  
# 2
```

## 5. Tuples
Tuples are ordered, immutable collections of items. They are defined using parentheses.

```python
coordinates = (10.0, 20.0)
person = ("John", 25, "Engineer")
```

### Accessing Tuple Elements
You can access elements in a tuple using their index, just like lists.

```python
latitude = coordinates[0]  
# 10.0
name = person[0]  
# "John"
```

## 6. Dictionaries
Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs. They are defined using curly braces.

```python
student = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 25,
    "courses": ["Math", "Science"]
}
```

### Accessing Dictionary Values
You can access values in a dictionary using their keys.

```python
student_name = student["name"]  
# "Alice"
student_age = student["age"]  
# 25
```

## 7. Sets
Sets are unordered collections of unique items. They are defined using curly braces or the `set()` function.

```python
colors = {"red", "green", "blue"}
unique_numbers = set([1, 2, 2, 3, 4])
```

### Adding and Removing Set Elements
You can add and remove items from a set using the `add()` and `remove()` methods.

```python
colors.add("yellow")
colors.remove("red")
```

## Summary

- **Numbers**: Integers (`int`) and Floats (`float`)
- **Strings**: Text data (`str`)
- **Boolean**: Logical values (`bool`)
- **Lists**: Ordered, mutable collections (`list`)
- **Tuples**: Ordered, immutable collections (`tuple`)
- **Dictionaries**: Unordered collections of key-value pairs (`dict`)
- **Sets**: Unordered collections of unique items (`set`)

Understanding these basic data types is essential for writing efficient and effective Python code. As you continue learning, you'll see how these data types are used in various programming scenarios.
